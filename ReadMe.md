# DS814 Algorithms and Data Structures

2nd Semester course

### Learning outcomes: 
	- use the algorithms taught in the course on concrete problem instances.
	- give precise arguments for the correctness or incorrectness of an algorithm.
	- determine the asymptotic running time of an algorithm.
	- adapt known algorithms and data structures to special cases of known problems or new problems.
	- design new algorithms for problems similar to those taught in the course. This
	includes giving a precise description of the algorithm, e.g. using pseudocode.
	- make expedient choices of data structures.
	- design new data structures based on known data structures.
	- design and implement a larger program, using algorithms and data structures taught in the course.
	- give precise arguments for the choices made in connection with the previous four items
